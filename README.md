# Go By Example

I'm attempting to walk through the examples found at [gobyexample](https://gobyexample.com/) within this repo to try and learn the Go programming language!

This repo is going to be a bit rough around the edges!

## Getting Started:

- I installed go via `homebrew` (`brew install go`)
  - Check `which go` or `go version` to ensure it works correctly and using a modern version
